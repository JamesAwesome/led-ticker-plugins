"""Guard 1 — Real-ICS corpus (class A: real-feed quirks).

Each fixture in tests/fixtures/calendar_corpus/ exercises one real-world
feed shape or quirk that was hardened against during the 8-round review.
These tests assert CURRENT correct behavior and are permanent regression guards.

``now`` is fixed per fixture so events are deterministically in-window.
