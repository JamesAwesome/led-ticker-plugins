"""Guard 2 — Recurrence cost-matrix (class B: expansion cost / DoS protection).

Parametrized over a matrix of RRULE shapes to assert that parse_ics is BOUNDED
for every combination of FREQ, DTSTART age, and modifier.  The entire file
must run in a few seconds — a slow run is itself a diagnostic signal that a
cost regression exists.

Matrix axes:
  FREQ: SECONDLY, MINUTELY, HOURLY, DAILY
  DTSTART: ~2 years past, near now, ~1 year future
  modifier: none (forever), COUNT=10, UNTIL≈now+5d, BY* (BYHOUR/BYDAY)

Assertions per cell:
  (a) parse_ics COMPLETES (timeout is enforced by pytest; slow = finding)
  (b) len(events) <= _MAX_OCCURRENCES
  (c) SECONDLY / MINUTELY -> 0 events (pre-filter drops them)

Far-past forever HOURLY/DAILY/WEEKLY correctness (formerly the clamp-equivalence
invariant) is now covered by `test_far_past_recurrence_is_fast_and_correct`,
which asserts the .between()-bounded expansion returns the exact in-window set.
